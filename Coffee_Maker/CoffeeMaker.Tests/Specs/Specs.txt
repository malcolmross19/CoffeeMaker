Given a Coffee Maker
And I press the brew button
Then I start a brew cycle

Given a Coffee Maker
And I put a filter in the filter holder
And I fill the filter with coffee grounds
And I slide the filter holder into its receptacle
And I pour up to 12 cups of water into the water strainer
When I start a brew cycle
Then the water is heated to boiling
And the water is sprayed over the coffee grounds
And the coffee drips through the filter into the pot
And the pot is kept warm by the warmer plate

Given a Coffee Maker
And I started a brew cycle
When the brew cycle is over
Then an indicator lights up
And I have a pot of coffee

Given a Coffee Maker
When the pressure valve opens
Then the pressure in the boiler is reduced
And the flow of water to the filter is stopped

Given a Coffee Maker
And a pot of coffee
When I remove the pot of coffee from the warming plate
Then the warming plate shuts off

Given a Coffee Maker
And a pot of coffee
And I started a brew cycle
When I remove the pot of coffee from the warming plate
Then the flow of water to the filter is stopped
